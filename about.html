                  About Chen
              </font>
              <br /><br />
              My name is Weiche Chen, I am a third-year software engineering student in KSU. I transfer
                from Highline College near Seattle in Washington State. Seattle rains a lot, I saw some
                junior engineers make 180k per year and work from home. Which is crazy. I obtained Canadian
                PR two months ago and I would transfer to a Canadian university this year. I choose software
                major because I wish I could provide better bread for my family. In my spare time, I like
                powerlifting and investing.

                <br /><br /><br />
                I understand that the good school, major and job are the key for most normal people to earn
                better bread for family. Therefore, I spend more time on schoolwork than before. I also
                work during college and make some investment. I did have failure investment in dogecoin that
                I realize I need to choose a safer way. I wish dogecoin could return above 0.28 usd one day
                so I may get the money back. Currently I have successful investment in tech mutual fund, I am
                looking for investing in Tesla if it drops lower. For powerlifting, I hold several Canadian
                national records and I did it with fever. The key is being lazy, lower the weight and volume.
                Staying foucs on recovery.

                <br /><br /><br />
                After graduate, I prefer working in Seattle because I figure out Seattle tech industry is very
                strong. The salary in Washington State for coders is similar as California State but less income
                tax and living expense. Also, The Canadian tuition is cheap, plus universal health care, good
                grant and zero interest student loan. For investment, I would keep dumping money in. Different
                portions in saving account, mutual fund, stocks, bitcoins. When the investment income is double more
                than my salary, I would retire. For powerlifting, my plan is break IPL world records, win IPL
                Olympia pro game whole stage, obtain USAPL pro, break USAPL national records, win Arnold whole
              stage. It is my true passion.
